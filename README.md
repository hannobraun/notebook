# Notebook

## About

I'm making notebooks. As a hobby. And I figured, why not make them open source.

In a literal sense, a notebook isn't hardware. But this is still an open hardware product, in the sense of ["anything physical that has public source files"][OSHWA FAQ]. I plan to include all information that is required to build these notebooks in this repository. Starting with tools used, materials and how to source them, and build instructions. If I end up creating custom tools to help me build more notebooks (which I *might* do), those designs will be open source too.

For now, please refer to [my build report of the first notebook](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/), while I'm still working on the more principled documentation that I'd like to include in this repository.
