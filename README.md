# Notebook

## About

I'm making notebooks. As a hobby. And I figured, why not make them open source.

In a literal sense, a notebook isn't hardware. But this is still an open hardware product, in the sense of ["anything physical that has public source files"][OSHWA FAQ]. I plan to include all information that is required to build these notebooks in this repository. Starting with tools used, materials and how to source them, and build instructions. The designs of any custom tools I make will also be open source.
