# Cost

## Material

- A4 paper (regular): 500 sheets = 7.84€ => 24 sheets = ~0.32€
- A4 paper (thick): no idea, but should be close to 0
- Binder's thread: 150m = 9.90€ => 4m (conservative estimate) = ~0.22€
- Bookmark ribbon: 25m = 8.65€ => 0.24m = ~0.08€
- Mull: 50m = 11.64€ => 0.135m = ~0.03€
- Cork leather: 1 sheet = 15.98€ => 1/8 sheet => ~2€

Total: 2.65€ (excluding VAT and material shipping costs)


## Shipping

- to Germany: 2.70€ (Deutsche Post, Großbrief 500g + Prio; VAT not applicable)


## Tools

Didn't calculate. Probably limited, as I'm not using anything fancy, but still outsized cost per notebook.


## Time

It's a hobby, so there's really no basis for calculation.
