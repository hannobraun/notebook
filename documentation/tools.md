# Tools

## Custom-built

So far, I've built one custom tool for making notebooks: A rather shitty book press, inspired by [this video by SeaLemon on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeg8MH0PtI).


## Specific tools

I've bought these specifically for making notebooks. I've linked the source I bought them from for each.

## Other

These are just standard tools that I already had in my workshop.

- A knife
