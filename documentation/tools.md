# Tools

## Custom-built

So far, I've custom-built one tool: a simple [book press](tools/book-press.md).


## Specific tools

I've bought these specifically for making notebooks. I've linked the source I bought them from for each.

- [Bookbinding needles](https://www.modulor.de/en/bookbinding-needle-l-62-mm-o-1-2-mm.html)
- [Corner punch for rounded corners](https://www.modulor.de/en/corner-punch-for-roundeed-corners-radius-ca-10-mm.html)


## Other

These are just standard tools that I already had in my workshop.

- A knife
- A ruler
- A combination square
- Coarse sandpaper (P40)
