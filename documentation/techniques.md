# Techniques

These are specific techniques that are required in the build process. They can be documented here separately, as they are self-contained, and can be used and practiced independently from the build process.

The build process documentation refers to them here, to keep that documentation reasonable clear.


## Paper preparation

### Folding

1. Push a shorter edge of the paper against the straight edge of the aluminium block.
2. Fold over the opposite edge, also push it against the straight edge.
3. Once both of the paper edges line up, push down on the paper to prevent it from moving.
4. Run your thumbs along the folded end of the paper, while still pushing on the paper with the rest of your fingers.

### Cutting in half

1. Fold the piece of paper.
2. Unfold it again.
3. Place the paper flat on the work surface; the outside of the fold on the bottom.
4. Place the straight edge of the aluminium block on the fold.
5. Cut along the fold, using the aluminium block as a ruler.


## Sewing

### Double-threading a needle

In addition to making a making the knot, make a second knot around the first one. The combined knots should be thick enough to not go through the sewing holes, which is important.

### Sewing the first signature

Sewing the first signature of the text block is different from sowing the other ones. Each signature is sewn to the previous ones, and this obviously can't work with the first.

The goal with sewing the first signature is to establish a sort of base that the following signatures can connect to.

### Sewing the second signature

The sewing of the second signature is closer to the other ones, but still a bit different, as the regular technique relies on there being two previous signatures.

### Sewing the rest of the signatures

The rest of the signatures are all sewn the same. They all connect to the previous signatures in the same way.

### Switching the thread

During the sewing of the signatures, you will run out of thread. While you could use a thread long enough to prevent that from happening, such a long thread is very cumbersome and awkward to use, and it will form unintended knots all the time. Overall, this causes more work than switching the thread a few times.

## Glueing

### Applying glue

1. Squeeze some glue out of the bottle, roughly distributing it over the whole area that needs to be glued. If you're not sure how much to use, err on the lower side. You can always add more later.
2. Then use the brush to distribute it more evenly, until it covers the whole surface.
3. If necessary, add more glue from the bottle where needed, and distribute that with the brush.
4. To the glue-up directly after. Directly after that, clean the brush (see next section).

### Cleaning the brush

1. Get a small container with enough water in it to submerge the bristles completely.
2. Move the brush around in the water.
3. Keep moving it around in the water, while pressing against the bottom of the container
4. Wipe the bristles off against the rim of the container. It helps if that rim is sharp, and has an overhang towards the inside of the container.
5. Repeat steps 2. to 4. until the brush is clean.
6. Put the brush down and let it dry.
