# Techniques

These are specific techniques that are required in the build process. They can be documented here separately, as they are self-contained, and can be used and practiced independently from the build process.

The build process documentation refers to them here, to keep that documentation reasonable clear.


## Sewing

### Double-threading a needle

In addition to making a making the knot, make a second knot around the first one. The combined knots should be thick enough to not go through the sewing holes, which is important.

### Sewing the first signature

Sewing the first signature of the text block is different from sowing the other ones. Each signature is sewn to the previous ones, and this obviously can't work with the first.

The goal with sewing the first signature is to establish a sort of base that the following signatures can connect to.

### Sewing the second signature

The sewing of the second signature is closer to the other ones, but still a bit different, as the regular technique relies on there being two previous signatures.

### Sewing the rest of the signatures

The rest of the signatures are all sewn the same. They all connect to the previous signatures in the same way.
