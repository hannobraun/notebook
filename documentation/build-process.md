# Build Process

This documentation of the build process is incomplete. For now, please refer to [my build report of the first notebook](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/). As I make more notebooks, I will document the process more thoroughly here.

Please refer to the documents about tools, materials, and techniques, which these steps refer to.


## Prepare the signatures

1. Take 24 sheets of paper.
2. Fold and unfold one sheet of paper.
3. Stack all sheets of so that the edges line up, the folded one at the top.
4. Use the aluminium block as a ruler, and cut all sheets along the fold line.

This results in 48 roughly A5-sized sheets of paper.

5. Fold the sheets of paper
   1. Take a stack of 4 sheets of paper.
   2. Fold the 4 sheets of paper together .
   3. Repeat until all sheets of paper are folded.

You now have the signatures that will be sewn together to make up the text block. Before we can sew them, we need to create holes to sew through.

6. Using a ruler, find the middle of a the folded edge of a signature.
7. Mark that middle with the pencil.
8. From that middle mark, make a mark ever 2cm along the folded edge.

You should now have one signature that has marks ever 2cm along the folded edge, with those marks centered on the middle.

9. Stack up all signatures, with the marked one up top.
10. Align the folded edges of all the signatures as best as possible.
11. Keeping them aligned, put a ruler against each mark you made.
12. Use the ruler and pencil to transfer the marks to the other signatures.

Now all signatures should have the same marks as the original one.

13. Make holes for sewing into all signatures
    1. Lay down the signature flat, with the marks upwards, so you can see them.
    2. Using the awl, puncture all the marks.
    3. Enlarge all those small holes, by sticking the awl through them.

The signatures are now ready for sewing.


## Create the text block

1. Cut off a bit over two arm's length of thread from the spool.

By making it a bit over two arm's lengths, it becomes a bit over one arm's length after you double it up in the next step. This is comfortable to handle, while long enough to not requiring too much re-threading

2. Double-thread the needle. See Techniques -> Sewing.
3. Sew the signatures. See Techniques -> Sewing.
4. Put the text block into the book press, to hold it in place.
5. Align the signatures, so the spine forms as straight a wall as feasible.

It doesn't need to be perfect. Just do the best you can, and make sure no signatures are hidden because they are recessed.

6. Clamp down the book press.
7. Apply two layers of PVA glue to the spine. Let each dry for 30 minutes.


## Add the end pages

1. Cut a thick sheet of paper in half, resulting in two A5-sized sheets.
2. Cut one of them in half again, resulting in two A6-sized sheets.

The two resulting sheets will be used as the end pages.

3. Lay the two end pages on top of each other, so one covers the other.
4. Move the top end page, so a part of it along a longer edge sticks out.

The part that sticks out should be a roughly 5mm broad strip.

5. Apply glue to that 5mm strip of the bottom end page.
6. Switch their positions.

Now the page with the glue applied should be on top. The strip of the bottom page that sticks out below the top page should be next to the strip of the top page that has glue applied.

7. Apply glue to the strip of the bottom page.

If you've done this correctly, you've applied glue to a 5mm strip along the folded edge of both end pages, without accidentally applying it anywhere else on the end pages.

8. Glue the end pages onto both sides of the text block.

The glued strips should be parallel to the spine, and the edges on the side should line up with the edges of the spine.

9. Press the end pages onto the text block for a moment, using your hands.

Do not use the book press for this, or you'll glue the text block to the book press.


## Strengthen the spine and add the bookmark

1. Cut off ~240mm of bookmark ribbon.
2. Cut off ~135mm of mull.
3. Fold the piece of mull in half along the long axis, to mark its middle.

The goal is to place the mull so that is is centered on top of the spine, along both axes.

4. Apply glue to the spine of the text block, where the mull will go.
5. Place bookmark ribbon on the spine, coming from a shorter edge.

~10mm of the bookmark ribbon should stick into the glued area.

6. Use the brush to press the bookmark ribbon into the glue.
7. Place the mull on the spine, so it is centered along both axes.
8. Apply glue to the mull, where it touches the spine.

Use the brush to push the mull onto the spine, so there are no creases.

9. Glue one flap of the mull onto the respective end page.

Again, use the brush to prevent creases in the mull.

10. Repeat with the other flap.
11. Keep applying glue, until the mesh structure is almost not visible any more.
12. Let it dry for 30 minutes.


## Add the cover

1. Cut out a rectangular piece of cork.

It should be big enough, that it will protrude everywhere after you glued it to the text block.

2. Apply PVA glue to one side of the text block.
3. Glue cover onto that side.
4. Clamp in book press, let it dry for 30 minutes.
5. Apply PVA glue to spine and other side of the text block.
6. Glue on rest of cover.

Pull the side of the cover that you're now glueing on towards the front of the text block, to make sure there is only a minimal gap between the spine of the text block and the cover there.

This doesn't work totally reliably to reduce the gap. I'm working on ideas for improvements.

7. Clamp in book press, let it dry for 30 minutes.


## Finish the notebook

1. Use combination square and knife to cut off a few millimeters of material on the left and right side of the notebook.

The goal here is to remove the chaos of protruding and recessed signatures, and the protruding cork cover. The result will invariably still be crooked, but don't worry.

2. Use coarse sandpaper (P40) to sand the walls straight.

Just do it by eye. If it looks straight, it is straight. If it doesn't look straight, use the combination square to check what you need to remove, using the spine as reference.

3. Cut and sand the front side in the same manner.

Use one of the newly sanded sides as reference for the combination square.

4. Round corners of all pages using the corner punch.

Doing three pages at a time is a reasonable maximum.

5. Round corners of the cover.

They're too thick for the corner punch. Use a knife, and cut along the previously rounded paper corners. If that doesn't result in a sufficiently round appearance, carefully use the sandpaper to round it off.

6. Sign the notebook on one of the end pages

This is it, done!
