# Build Process

This documentation of the build process is incomplete. For now, please refer to [my build report of the first notebook](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/). As I make more notebooks, I will document the process more thoroughly here.

Please refer to the documents about tools, materials, and techniques, which these steps refer to.


## Prepare the signatures

1. Take 24 sheets of paper.
2. Fold all sheets of paper.
3. Using a knife and a ruler, cut the folded end off of each sheet.

This results in 48 roughly A5-sized sheets of paper.

4. Fold all sheets of paper. Collect the folded sheets into stacks of 4.
5. Nest the 4 folded sheets of each stack into each other, to create signature.

You now have the signatures that will be sewn together to make up the text block. Before we can sew them, we need to create holes to sew through.

6. Using a ruler, find the middle of a the folded edge of a signature.
7. Mark that middle with the pencil.
8. From that middle mark, make a mark ever 2cm along the folded edge.

You should now have one signature that has marks ever 2cm along the folded edge, with those marks centered on the middle.

9. Stack up all signatures, with the marked one up top.
10. Align the folded edges of all the signatures as best as possible.
11. Keeping them aligned, put a ruler against each mark you made.
12. Use the ruler and pencil to transfer the marks to the other signatures.

Now all signatures should have the same marks as the original one.

13. Make holes for sewing into all signatures
    1. Lay down the signature flat, with the marks upwards, so you can see them.
    2. Using the awl, puncture all the marks.
    3. Enlarge all those small holes, by sticking the awl through them.

The signatures are now ready for sewing.


## Create the text block

1. Cut off a bit over two arm's length of thread from the spool.

By making it a bit over two arm's lengths, it becomes a bit over one arm's length after you double it up in the next step. This is comfortable to handle, while long enough to not requiring too much re-threading

2. Double-thread the needle. See Techniques -> Sewing.
3. Sew the signatures. See Techniques -> Sewing.
4. Put the text block into the book press, to hold it in place.
5. Align the signatures, so the spine forms as straight a wall as feasible.

It doesn't need to be perfect. Just do the best you can, and make sure no signatures are hidden because they are recessed.

6. Clamp down the book press.
7. Apply two layers of PVA glue to the spine. Let each dry for 30 minutes.


## Create the end pages

1. Fold a sheet of thick paper along the middle.
2. Cut off the folded end.

This should result in two A5-ish-sized sheets of thick paper.

3. Fold the sheets of paper along the middle again.
4. Glue the folded sheets, to create sheets with double the thickness.
   1. Apply PVA glue to half of the inner side of the folded sheets.
   2. Close it again and press it together.
   3. Let it dry for 15 minutes.

This results in two thick A6-ish-sized sheets of paper that can be used as end pages.

5. Lay the two end pages on top of each other, so that the folded edges point in the right direction, and a 5mm strip along the folded edge of the bottom end page sticks out from the top one.
6. Apply glue to that 5mm strip of the bottom end page.
7. Switch their positions (put the bottom on on top now). Again, make it so that a 5mm strip of the (new) lower end page sticks out from below the (new top) one.
8. Apply glue to that 5mm strip too.

If you've done this correctly, you've applied glue to a 5mm strip along the folded edge of both end pages, without accidentally applying it anywhere else on the end pages.

9. Glue the end pages onto both sides of the text block, so that the glued strips are parallel to the spine, and the folded edges line up with one end of the spine.

At this point, I put that into the book press, hoping for the best. Predictably, I glued the text block to the book press, both top and bottom sides.

I managed to get them separated using a utility knife blade, which damaged the end pages slightly, and left residue on the book press. I hope to come up with something better while building notebook #4.


## Strengthen the spine

1. Cut off a piece of mull from the roll; length should be the length of the spine minus 20mm.
2. Fold the piece of mull in half along the long axis, to mark its middle.
3. Apply glue to the spine of the text block.

It's probably a good idea to apply glue only where the mull will go, so no glue on each end of the spine, for 10mm to the edge. Then the bookmark can be glued onto the spine, without being glued right up to the edge of the spine. Meaning the text block can be cut to size later, without damaging the bookmark.

I didn't do it like that for notebook #3, and it caused all kinds of problems.

4. Place the piece of mull on the spine, so the middle of the spine and the middle of the mull line up along their long axes.
5. Apply more glue on the outside of the mull. Use the brush to push the mull onto the spine, so there are no creases.
6. Once the mull is fixed to the spine, glue the rest of the mull to the outside of the text block. Flatten it with the brush to prevent creases.
7. Apply enough glue, so the mesh structure of the mull is almost not visible any more.
8. Let it dry for 30 minutes.


## Add the cover

1. Cut out a rectangular piece of cork.

It should be big enough, that it will protrude everywhere after you glued it to the text block.

2. Apply PVA glue to one side of the text block.
3. Glue cover onto that side.
4. Clamp in book press, let it dry for 30 minutes.
5. Apply PVA glue to spine and other side of the text block.
6. Glue on rest of cover.

Pull the side of the cover that you're now glueing on towards the front of the text block, to make sure there is only a minimal gap between the spine of the text block and the cover there.

This doesn't work totally reliably to reduce the gap. I'm working on ideas for improvements.

7. Clamp in book press, let it dry for 30 minutes.


## Finish the notebook

1. Use combination square and knife to cut off a few millimeters of material on the left and right side of the notebook.

The goal here is to remove the chaos of protruding and recessed signatures, and the protruding cork cover. The result will invariably still be crooked, but don't worry.

2. Use coarse sandpaper (P40) to sand the walls straight.

Just do it by eye. If it looks straight, it is straight. If it doesn't look straight, use the combination square to check what you need to remove, using the spine as reference.

3. Cut and sand the front side in the same manner.

Use one of the newly sanded sides as reference for the combination square.

4. Round corners of all pages using the corner punch.

Doing three pages at a time is a reasonable maximum.

5. Round corners of the cover.

They're too thick for the corner punch. Use a knife, and cut along the previously rounded paper corners. If that doesn't result in a sufficiently round appearance, carefully use the sandpaper to round it off.

6. Sign the notebook on one of the end pages

This is it, done!
