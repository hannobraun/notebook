# Build Process

This documentation of the build process is incomplete. For now, please refer to [my build report of the first notebook](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/). As I make more notebooks, I will document the process more thoroughly here.

Please refer to the documents about tools and materials, which these steps refer to.


## Prepare the signatures

1. Take 24 sheets of paper.
2. Fold all sheets of paper.
3. Using a knife and a ruler, cut the folded end off of each sheet.

This results in 48 roughly A5-sized sheets of paper.

4. Fold all sheets of paper.

Next up, you need to create signatures and prepare them for sewing. When I did this for notebook #2, I did the operations in the wrong order, resulting in a lot of extra work. I'm not going to document those wrong steps here, and I don't want to document what I think the correct steps are, before validating them in an actual build.

I intend to add the correct steps once I had a chance to validate them with notebook #3.


## Create the text block

I haven't gotten to this part yet with notebook #2.
