# Build Process

This documentation of the build process is incomplete. For now, please refer to [my build report of the first notebook](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/). As I make more notebooks, I will document the process more thoroughly here.

Please refer to the documents about tools and materials, which these steps refer to.


## Prepare the signatures

1. Take 24 sheets of paper.
2. Fold all sheets of paper.
3. Using a knife and a ruler, cut the folded end off of each sheet.

This results in 48 roughly A5-sized sheets of paper.

4. Fold all sheets of paper.

Next up, you need to create signatures and prepare them for sewing. When I did this for notebook #2, I did the operations in the wrong order, resulting in a lot of extra work. I'm not going to document those wrong steps here, and I don't want to document what I think the correct steps are, before validating them in an actual build.

I intend to add the correct steps once I had a chance to validate them with notebook #3.


## Create the text block

1. Cut off a length of thread from the spool.

In principle, the thread should be as long as possible, as you'll otherwise have to re-thread too often. In practice, making the thread too long makes it hard to handle and causes a lot of extra work.

Make the thread as long as you can comfortably handle after it's doubled up. I'll try to figure out how long exactly that is, over the next builds.

2. Double-thread the needle.

This video shows how to do that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8wlmwZC_g4

3. Make a double knot at the loose ends of the double thread.
4. Sew the signatures.

I haven't gotten any further yet with notebook #2.
