# Build Process

This documentation of the build process is incomplete. For now, please refer to [my build report of the first notebook](https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/notebook/). As I make more notebooks, I will document the process more thoroughly here.

Please refer to the documents about tools, materials, and techniques, which these steps refer to.


## Prepare the signatures

1. Take 48 sheets of paper.
2. Drill holes into the whole stack, using the hole guide.
3. Fold the drilled sheets.
   1. Take a stack of 4 sheets of paper.
   2. Fold the 4 sheets of paper together .
   3. Repeat until all sheets of paper are folded.

The signatures are now ready for sewing.


## Create the text block

1. Cut off a bit over two arm's length of thread from the spool.

By making it a bit over two arm's lengths, it becomes a bit over one arm's length after you double it up in the next step. This is comfortable to handle, while long enough to not requiring too much re-threading

2. Double-thread the needle. See Techniques -> Sewing.
3. Sew the signatures. See Techniques -> Sewing.
4. Put the text block into the book press, to hold it in place.
5. Align the signatures, so the spine forms as straight a wall as feasible.

It doesn't need to be perfect. Just do the best you can, and make sure no signatures are hidden because they are recessed.

6. Clamp down the book press.
7. Apply two layers of PVA glue to the spine. Let each dry for 30 minutes.


## Add the end pages

1. Cut a thick sheet of paper in half, resulting in two A5-sized sheets.
2. Cut one of them in half again, resulting in two A6-sized sheets.

The two resulting sheets will be used as the end pages.

3. Lay the two end pages on top of each other, so one covers the other.
4. Move the top end page, so a part of it along a longer edge sticks out.

The part that sticks out should be a roughly 5mm broad strip.

5. Apply glue to that 5mm strip of the bottom end page.
6. Switch their positions.

Now the page with the glue applied should be on top. The strip of the bottom page that sticks out below the top page should be next to the strip of the top page that has glue applied.

7. Apply glue to the strip of the bottom page.

If you've done this correctly, you've applied glue to a 5mm strip along the folded edge of both end pages, without accidentally applying it anywhere else on the end pages.

8. Glue the end pages onto both sides of the text block.

The glued strips should be parallel to the spine, and the edges on the side should line up with the edges of the spine.

9. Press the end pages onto the text block for a moment, using your hands.

Do not use the book press for this, or you'll glue the text block to the book press.


## Strengthen the spine and add the bookmark

1. Cut off ~240mm of bookmark ribbon.
2. Cut off ~135mm of mull.
3. Fold the piece of mull in half along the long axis, to mark its middle.

The goal is to place the mull so that is is centered on top of the spine, along both axes.

4. Put text block into the book press.

It should stick out far enough, so the mull can be glued on.

5. Apply glue to the spine of the text block, where the mull will go.
6. Place bookmark ribbon on the spine, coming from a shorter edge.

~10mm of the bookmark ribbon should stick into the glued area.

7. Use the brush to press the bookmark ribbon into the glue.
8. Place the mull on the spine, so it is centered along both axes.
9. Apply glue to the mull, where it touches the spine.

Use the brush to push the mull onto the spine, so there are no creases.

10. Glue one flap of the mull onto the respective end page.

Again, use the brush to prevent creases in the mull.

11. Repeat with the other flap.
12. Keep applying glue, until the mesh structure is almost not visible any more.
13. Let it dry for 30 minutes.


## Finish the text block

1. Use sandpaper to sand the short sides of text block, neighboring the spine.

It doesn't need to be perfect, but any crevices should be evened out. Use combination square from the spine to figure out how the side should be oriented, if necessary.

2. Use sandpaper to sand long side of the text block, opposite the spine.

Use combination square from one of the sides to figure out orientation, if necessary.

3. Round all corners with the corner punch


## Add the cover

1. Cut out a rectangular piece of cork.

It should be big enough, that it will protrude everywhere after you glued it to the text block.

2. Put a sheet of parchment paper between one end page and rest of text block.

The sheet should be big enough to stick out on all sides under the end page.

3. Apply PVA glue to one side of the text block.
3. Glue cover onto that side.
4. Clamp in book press, let it dry for 30 minutes.
5. Apply PVA glue to the inside of the cover, where it will touch the spine.
6. Put parchment paper under the other end page.
7. Apply PVA glue to that side of the text block.
8. Press cover onto text block, starting at the already glued side.

By starting at that side, and moving over the spine, towards the free end of the cover, you minimize the gap between cover and spine.

9. Clamp in book press, let it dry for 30 minutes.


## Cut cover to size

Now the cover needs to be cut to size, so it doesn't stick out of the text block. This didn't work out so well for notebook #4, so I'll keep experimenting with techniques.

This is it, done!
