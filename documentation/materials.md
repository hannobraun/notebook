# Materials

These are the materials required to make a notebook. I've linked the source for anything I've specifically bought. Anything without a link, I already had.

- Regular paper (A4): I'm just using standard printer paper right now. I plan to get more fancy about it at some point, but for now, this is good.
- Thick paper (A4): I'm using some old printer paper from the 90s I found. It's a bit thicker than modern printer paper.

- PVA glue
