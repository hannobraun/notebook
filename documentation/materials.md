# Materials

These are the materials required to make a notebook. I've linked the source for anything I've specifically bought. Anything without a link, I already had.

- Paper (A4): I'm just using standard printer paper right now. I plan to get more fancy about it at some point, but for now, this is good.
- [Binder's thread](https://www.modulor.de/en/linen-binder-s-thread-th-0-42mm-type-30-3-150m-black.html)
- PVA glue
