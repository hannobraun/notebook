# Improvements

## Process

- Consider pressing each signature separately, before sewing
  That might reduce the overall thickness at the spine.
- Build jig to precisely fold signatures
- Try preparing the cover before glueing

- Use thick paper in the right size and thickness
  Again, would save some preparation work.
- Find better way to cut off material
  Using a knife is tedious and requires sanding afterwards. While that gives the notebook a rough appearance that I kinda like, it would be nicer to just cut if off straight, in one go, using a specialized tool.


  ## Tools

  - The hole guide doesn't work perfectly
    It's too easy to enlarge the holes accidentally. It might work better to have a funnel-like shape, as long as that works with the total length of the drill bit.
    Long-term, a harder material would be good, but that should come after prototyping.


## Product

- Consider using lighter paper
  The A5 paper is a bit heavier (120g/m²) than normal paper (80g/m²). I have yet to see how the end product turns out, but the added thickness certainly makes the problems with the spine worse.
- Make sure spine is straight, and there's not a large gap to the cover
- Add flexible band that can keep the notebook closed

- Make sure the spine can bend sufficiently
  It doesn't bend as well as a Moleskine does. It's fine when writing on the side of the notebook that has more pages, but when writing side, it's significantly less comfortable than a Moleskine.
  Maybe the problem is that the spine is too strong. Maybe I should not glue it at all, and just rely on the sewing. Another idea is to try and flatten the bend of the signatures better. Not sure if that will help, but the Moleskine's signatures are significantly flatter there.
- Use pre-printed pages
  I'd like to have the page number on each page, as well as a subtle grid pattern.
