# Improvements

## Process

- Try folding complete signatures in one go
  Collect 4 sheets, fold them together.
- Fold against some barrier
  To fix the ends of the sheets, keeping them from moving against each other.
- Use regular paper in the right size
  That would save some preparation work.
- Use thick paper in the right size and thickness
  Again, would save some preparation work.
- Get some tool for applying PVA glue
  Maybe a brush, but I'm not sure how many times I could use a single one. Ideally, I'd find something that allows me to apply PVA glue in a controlled way, while being easy to clean, thus infinitely reusable.
- Find better way to cut off material
  Using a knife is tedious and requires sanding afterwards. While that gives the notebook a rough appearance that I kinda like, it would be nicer to just cut if off straight, in one go, using a specialized tool.
