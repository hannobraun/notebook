# Improvements

## Process

- Try folding complete signatures in one go
  Collect 4 sheets, fold them together.
- Cut text block to size before adding the cover
  Otherwise the bookmark gets in the way.
- Use regular paper in the right size
  That would save some preparation work.
- Use thick paper in the right size and thickness
  Again, would save some preparation work.
- Find better way to cut off material
  Using a knife is tedious and requires sanding afterwards. While that gives the notebook a rough appearance that I kinda like, it would be nicer to just cut if off straight, in one go, using a specialized tool.


## Product

- Make sure spine is straight, and there's not a large gap to the cover
- Add ribbon that can be used as bookmark

- Add flexible band that can keep the notebook closed

- Use pre-printed pages
  I'd like to have the page number on each page, as well as a subtle grid pattern.
