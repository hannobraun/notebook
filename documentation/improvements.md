# Improvements

## Process

- Use regular paper in the right size
  That would save some preparation work.

- Build jig to precisely place holes
  Preferably by puncturing (or drilling?) through all sheets at once.
- Build jig to precisely fold signatures
- Try preparing the cover before glueing

- Use thick paper in the right size and thickness
  Again, would save some preparation work.
- Find better way to cut off material
  Using a knife is tedious and requires sanding afterwards. While that gives the notebook a rough appearance that I kinda like, it would be nicer to just cut if off straight, in one go, using a specialized tool.


## Product

- Find a way to make the cover and end page more bendable
  With the recent models, the first pages have a harder time opening than previously. I think the problem is, that the cover is more or less directly connected to the text block, via the end page, where that is glued to the text block.
  Idea: Have double end pages, with the outer end page glued to the cover, the inner glued to the text block along the 5mm strip, as currently. The fold of the double end page provides a joint that prevents the cover from applying force to the text block, when the cover is folded out.
- Make sure spine is straight, and there's not a large gap to the cover
- Add flexible band that can keep the notebook closed

- Make sure the spine can bend sufficiently
  It doesn't bend as well as a Moleskine does. It's fine when writing on the side of the notebook that has more pages, but when writing side, it's significantly less comfortable than a Moleskine.
  Maybe the problem is that the spine is too strong. Maybe I should not glue it at all, and just rely on the sewing. Another idea is to try and flatten the bend of the signatures better. Not sure if that will help, but the Moleskine's signatures are significantly flatter there.
- Use pre-printed pages
  I'd like to have the page number on each page, as well as a subtle grid pattern.
