# Improvements

## Process

- Use regular paper in the right size
  That would save some preparation work.
- Use thick paper in the right size and thickness
  Again, would save some preparation work.
- Get some tool for applying PVA glue
  Maybe a brush, but I'm not sure how many times I could use a single one. Ideally, I'd find something that allows me to apply PVA glue in a controlled way, while being easy to clean, thus infinitely reusable.
- Find better way to cut off material
  Using a knife is tedious and requires sanding afterwards. While that gives the notebook a rough appearance that I kinda like, it would be nicer to just cut if off straight, in one go, using a specialized tool.


## Product

- Make sure spine is straight, and there's not a large gap to the cover
- Add ribbon that can be used as bookmark
- Add flexible band that can keep the notebook closed
