# Book Press

So far, I've built one custom tool for making notebooks: A rather shitty book press, inspired by [this video by SeaLemon on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeg8MH0PtI) (to be clear: mine is shitty, not the one in the video).

I built this without any plans, and given that it doesn't work that great, I'm not going to create them now. I do have some ideas for a fancier one, but no idea if or when I'll actually do it.
