# Puncturing Jig

This is the design for an unfinished jig for putting holes in paper accurately, using an awl. I decided to set it aside for now, as I've grown increasingly frustrated with it and also hit some problems with the design that I'm not sure how to overcome.

I'll either pick it back up or remove it from the repository at some point, but for now it stays here.
